# Maven RHEL <em>Algorithm constraints check failed on keysize limits: RSA 2048 bit key used with certificate</em> error

I recently wanted to build a small Spring Boot utility and created a project using Spring Initializer. It worked all fine until I tried to use `./mvnw spring-boot:run`,
where the application failed with a quite confusing error (manually wrapped here):

```

The strange part here is the `Algorithm constraints check failed on keysize limits: RSA 2048 bit key used with certificate`.

While researching the exception I found only errors regarding 1048 bit keys, but there was a hint to `java.security` file.
So I checked mine, but on the first look only found the following, which limits keys *below* 2048 bits. Very confusing.

```
# $JAVA_HOME/conf/security/java.security
jdk.security.legacyAlgorithms=SHA1, \
    RSA keySize < 2048, DSA keySize < 2048
```

Going on with my very confused, I finally found a small hint: `/etc/crypto-policies`.

Checking there I found this:

```
$ cat /etc/crypto-policies/config
DEFAULT:MYCRYPTO1:NO-AES128
```

`MYCRYPTO1` you may ask, and so did I. Seems to be the placeholder value used by this RHEL hardening guide (I was running this on a shared machine not set up by a collague).
[5.7. Customizing system-wide cryptographic policies with policy modifiers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#customizing-system-wide-cryptographic-policies-with-policy-modifiers_using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies)

And there also is a `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/java.config`, which includes the following; note the `RSA keySize < 3072` -- this fits our error!

```
jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, DSA, RSA keySize < 3072
```

But how does this get into JVM?

After some digging around I found a hint to `security.useSystemPropertiesFile` which is included in my `java.security` file, but I did not find it in Java documentation.

```
# $JAVA_HOME/config/security/java.security

#
# Determines whether this properties file will be appended to
# using the system properties file stored at
# /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/java.config
#
security.useSystemPropertiesFile=true
```

Turns out to be a Fedora/RHEL patch!

https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/java-11-openjdk/blob/rawhide/f/pr3694-rh1340845-support_fedora_rhel_system_crypto_policy.patch

Whem; that was fun to look for.
